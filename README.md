This project was designed for understand and lern SDR's. You can find in /GNU_Radio a little project of an FM radio with FFT and Waterfall graphics. 
With Sdr_Thread.py you can run a little spectrum analizer in Python.
The two of them are still in progress.
The device used is a RTL2832 based TV reciever.

install librtlsdr.so in Debian/Ubuntu

	sudo apt install librtlsdr-dev

install pyrtlsdr

	pip install pyrtlsdr

	sudo apt install gr-osmosdr
